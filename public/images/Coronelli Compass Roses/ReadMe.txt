Coronelli: A Free 17th Century Compass Rose Brush Set for Fantasy Maps
Version 1.0

The six compass roses within this brush set are taken from the first atlas volume of the Atlante Veneto by... you guessed it, Vincenzo Coronelli! They are included as a Photoshop .abr file and as six individual pngs labeled by their language.

More details on this set and other brushes can be found at: blog.kmalexander.com
