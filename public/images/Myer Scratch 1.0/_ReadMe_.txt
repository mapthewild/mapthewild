Myer Scratch: A Free 18th Century Scrimshaw Typeface
Version 1.0

Myer Scratch is extracted from the same powderhorn as the Myer Brush set. It's pretty raw, but with some post-processing, it can add that handcrafted feel to a map. If you were looking for "The old man in the tavern drew this map for us" vibes, you found the right font.

Not every glyph was accounted for—Q, V, X, and Z all were constructed from other letter forms on the powder horn. The numbers were also limited, so I had to do the same thing for 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. As with the faked letters, I constructed them from other carvings so they maintain the feel of the set as a whole.

To keep that handcrafted quality, I have included numerous alternate glyphs; this allows you to vary the letters and keep the font looking more handcrafted, especially in words that repeat letters; subtle differences in how a glyph is rendered only add to that handcrafted mystique, which is a significant tenant of my #NoBadMaps project.

Thanks for downloading this font, and I hope you find it useful.
