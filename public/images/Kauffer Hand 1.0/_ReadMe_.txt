Kauffer Hand: A Free 18th Century Typeface
Version 1.0

Kauffer Hand and its two variants are extracted from the same map as the Müller Cartography Brush set and are named after Michael Kauffer, one of the engravers who published the map in 1726.

This typeface is a bit cleaner than Myer Scratch, but it could still use some softening to help it feel as realistic as possible. When pulling from these historical documents, not every glyph is accounted for—J, Q, and q in the base Hand, X and Y in Italics, and the Q in Title were reconstructed from other documents labeled with a similar style to fill out the alphabet and maintain a consistent tone with the typeface. (If you want an even more polished version in a similar style, check out Three Isle Press's Geographica family.)

The three variant styles can label your projects in multiple ways. Müller used Italics for smaller settlements, and Hand for larger ones. Title was used for bigger labels or for the map's title. There are many options with this one; experiment and find a way to make it your own.
