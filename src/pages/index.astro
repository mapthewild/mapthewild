          I've been building things for a while now—prototypes, mostly. Tools that help people think differently about their relationships, their careers, their own minds. Not productivity tools. Not apps that capture more. Tools that change how you see.
        </p>

        <p>
          This site is where those experiments live. Or will live. Right now it's mostly a place for me to think out loud about what I'm building and why.
        </p>

        <p>
          The name comes from an idea I keep returning to: that knowledge isn't a database you query, it's a territory you explore. Some parts are well-mapped. Most aren't. The interesting stuff happens at the edges, where the paths run out and you have to make your own.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm interested in:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-400">
          <li>Metacognitive tools—software that shows you how you think, not what to think</li>
          <li>Ritual design—structured experiences that create space for reflection</li>
          <li>The gap between what AI can generate and what's actually useful</li>
          <li>Building in public, slowly, without a particular destination</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If any of that resonates, stick around. I'll be posting prototypes, half-formed ideas, and the occasional coherent thought.
        </p>
