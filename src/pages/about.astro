        I'm not sure what this is. A blog? A junk drawer with delusions of grandeur? A series of half-finished thoughts that refused to stay in my head?
      </p>

      <p>
        Probably all three.
      </p>

      <p>
        What's here: field notes from transitions—the "what am I even doing" kind. Career pivots when you don't have a landing spot picked out. Designing things before you know if they'll work. The thinking that happens when you stop pretending you have answers.
      </p>

      <p class="italic" style="color: var(--color-ink-muted);">
        (I built a whole site for this and I'm still not sure what it is. Which feels about right.)
      </p>

      <p>
        The <code>[[bracketed things]]</code> are tools. Click one and you can play with it, break it, steal the parts you like. Sometimes I don't know what I think until I've built something that thinks differently than I do.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're mid-transition, or building something weird, or just here to watch someone fumble around in public—welcome. The coffee's imaginary but the confusion is real.
