Metacognition is thinking about thinking. A metacognitive tool doesn't give you answers—it shows you the shape of your questions.

The [[Archetype Tool:archetypal-reflection-tool]] is a pure example: it tracks which lenses you choose across three rounds, then synthesizes what your choices reveal about your cognitive strategy. The insight isn't "here's what to do." It's "here's how you approached this."

## Why This Matters

Most software treats thinking as a black box. Input goes in, output comes out. The process in between is invisible.

But the process *is* the point. Two people can reach the same decision through completely different reasoning. One might be exploring intuitively while the other is systematically testing. Same output, different cognition.

[[Tools for thinking:tools-for-thinking]] become more powerful when they make this visible.

## The Three Logics

The Archetype Tool is built on three fundamental ways of knowing:

**Pattern Recognition (Magic)** — Following intuition, seeing connections, trusting emergence. The Explorer and Weaver archetypes live here.

**Relational Negotiation (Religion)** — Weighing values, honoring competing claims, seeking alignment. The Sage and Mediator archetypes.

**Systematic Testing (Science)** — Breaking down, testing, iterating. The Builder and Analyst archetypes.

Everyone uses all three. But when you're uncertain, you tend to lean one direction. The tool shows you your lean.

## Metacognition in Other Tools

The [[Seven Year Navigator:seven-year-career-navigator]] is metacognitive in a different way. Its "Whisper Detector" surfaces signals you might be ignoring—not career advice, but awareness of your own state.

The [[Death to Divorce:death-to-divorce]] couples ritual creates metacognitive moments through its "Values Mirror" phase: you see what your partner said, then reflect on what you said. The comparison generates insight that neither answer alone would produce.

## The Design Principle

A metacognitive tool should leave you with better questions, not just better answers. The [[contemplative pause:contemplative-pause]] before the Archetype synthesis exists to prevent premature closure. You need time to sit with what emerged before the tool interprets it for you.

This is the opposite of "move fast and break things." It's "slow down and notice things."

## What Makes It Work

**Reflection, not just recording.** Writing thoughts down isn't metacognitive. Comparing what you wrote yesterday to what you wrote today can be.

**Structure without prescription.** The tool provides a container. You provide the content.

**Timing.** [[Ritual design:ritual-design]] teaches that the when matters as much as the what. Weekly reflection hits different than daily.

The goal is a kind of cognitive proprioception—knowing where your mind is in space.
