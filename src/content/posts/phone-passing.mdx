The [[Death to Divorce:death-to-divorce]] couples ritual is built around a simple mechanic: one person holds the phone. When they're done, they hand it to the other person.

This sounds trivial. It isn't.

## The Talking Stick, Updated

Indigenous cultures developed the talking stick to solve a coordination problem: how do you have a conversation where everyone actually listens instead of just waiting for their turn to speak?

The answer is asymmetry. When you hold the stick, you speak. When you don't, you listen. The physical object creates a clear boundary.

Phone passing works the same way. When your partner has the phone, you literally cannot peek at their answers. You cannot influence what they write. You can only wait.

The waiting is the feature.

## Why Shared Screens Fail

Most digital relationship tools put both partners on the same screen. Makes sense, right? You're doing this together.

But togetherness can be premature. If you're composing your answer while your partner watches (or while you're watching them), you're performing rather than reflecting. You're already editing for your audience before you know what you actually think.

The split in Death to Divorce—one person answers while the other steps away—creates space for genuine reflection. You find out what your partner said only after you've committed to what you said.

## The Handoff as Ritual Moment

The physical passing of the phone isn't just logistics. It's a [[ritual design:ritual-design]] element.

"Hand the phone to Sarah" appears on screen. This is a prompt, not just a message. It marks a transition. The attention is explicitly moving from one person to another.

In [[tools for thinking:tools-for-thinking]], these micro-transitions matter. They signal that something is changing. They create psychological punctuation.

## Values Mirror

The most interesting phase comes after both partners have answered separately. The "Values Mirror" shows you what your partner said about appreciation, then asks you to reflect.

This only works because you didn't know their answer when you wrote yours. The comparison becomes generative rather than performative. You're discovering something, not confirming something.

## The Design Lesson

Phone passing taught me that sometimes the best feature is a constraint. Making it impossible to peek creates honesty. Making the handoff explicit creates ritual.

The [[Seven Year Navigator:seven-year-career-navigator]] uses a similar principle with its "Whisper Detector": the questions are designed to surface things you might hide from yourself if you were going too fast.

Constraints aren't obstacles to good design. They're often the mechanism of it.
