We're told life moves in neat little boxes - graduate by this age, career by that, house, marriage, kids, retirement. Checking boxes becomes 'advancing.' But what if we're missing something bigger? What if instead of counting years, we understood how we naturally orient ourselves to the world around us? Not just surviving each phase, but actually seeing how we form, grow, and transform in cycles that look nothing like the checkboxes we're handed.

A child figures out the world by orienting themselves to what's around them. Home, family, the basics of being. Then their entire world shifts to understanding other people. Friends become everything, their compass for making sense of life. Just when they've settled into that understanding, they're faced with figuring out where they fit in the working world.

These shifts happen whether we notice them or not. While we're checking society's boxes, these deeper cycles are running underneath. That feeling that something isn't quite right? You're probably just using someone else's map.

These cycles run in roughly seven-year patterns. Not the kind you mark with birthday candles or career reviews. Each cycle is about how you're oriented - to the world, to others, to work, to yourself. And each brings its own kind of understanding.

Think about what happens around 28. The career path that seemed so clear at 21 starts feeling like someone else's game. It's not a crisis - it's a natural shift in how you're oriented to everything around you. You're not lost, you're just moving from orienting to work to orienting to self.

By 35, another shift happens. The questions change from 'who am I?' to 'who are we?' Your orientation moves outward again, but with all the understanding you've gathered along the way. Each cycle builds on the last, but only if you recognize what's actually happening.

Most of us fight these cycles. We try to force ourselves to stay oriented the way we were, or the way others tell us we should be. But what if instead of fighting them, we worked with them? What if we understood that feeling disconnected from what used to matter is actually a sign you're right on track?
