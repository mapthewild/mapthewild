What does a year of thinking look like when you map it?

After 888 conversations with Claude—658,889 words written—I wanted to see the shape of my intellectual territory. Not a list of topics, but a *landscape*. Something I could explore.

The [[Thinking Territories Map:civfogmap]] is what emerged. It's a fog-of-war visualization where territories reveal themselves based on how much I've engaged with them.

## The Territories

My conversations cluster into distinct regions:

### Contemplative Technology (12,560 words)
The intersection of awareness practice and digital tools. How do we build technology that supports reflection rather than distraction? This includes work on [[VoiceBro:voicebro]], attention design, and the philosophical foundations of "contemplative UX."

### Relationships & Connection (18,182 words)
The economics and rituals of human connection. From the [[Death to Divorce:death-to-divorce]] couples ritual to research on relationship maintenance, this territory explores how we sustain the bonds that matter.

### Life Phases & Transitions (16,243 words)
Career cycles, personal growth frameworks, and the [[Seven Year Navigator:seven-year-career-navigator]]. The question here: how do we recognize when we're in transition before it becomes a crisis?

### Systems Thinking (15,237 words)
Social-technical systems, boundary spanning, cybernetics. The conceptual toolkit I use to understand complex problems. This connects to the [[WikiFogMap:wikifogmap]]—a systems thinking explorer.

### Creative Writing (15,406 words)
Space opera, story voice, narrative craft. The territory where I'm least strategic and most playful.

### Geopolitics (13,533 words)
Strategic triangles, diplomatic communication, civilizational patterns. A quieter territory, but one I return to when I need perspective on large-scale change.

## How the Map Works

The fog map borrows from strategy games: territories start obscured and reveal as you explore. Hover to see word counts. Click to dive into sub-regions.

What's revealed isn't just what I've *thought about*—it's what I've thought about *enough to write through*. The fog represents potential territory; the cleared areas represent claimed ground.

## Patterns I Noticed

**The center is integration.** My most active conversations aren't in any single territory—they're in the connections between territories. "Integration Intelligence" (22,571 words) sits at the intersection of systems thinking, personal growth, and contemplative tech.

**Whispers become territories.** Areas that started as brief mentions eventually earned their own space. VoiceBro began as a stray idea in a creative writing conversation.

**Work and personal blur.** I filtered out explicitly work-related conversations, but the boundary is porous. Systems thinking serves both consulting clients and personal sense-making.

## Try the Map
