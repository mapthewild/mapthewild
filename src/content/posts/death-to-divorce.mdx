What if the secret to a lasting relationship isn't grand gestures or expensive therapy, but a simple weekly [[ritual design:ritual-design]] you do together on a single phone?

That's the premise behind [[this tool:dtd-app]]—a couples ritual application that guides partners through warm-up questions, values mirroring, and weekly experiments.

## The Problem

Most relationship tools fall into two camps: either they're passive (journal prompts you never finish) or they're intensive (therapy sessions that require scheduling and money). There's a gap in between—something that's structured enough to be meaningful but light enough to actually happen.

The [[phone passing:phone-passing]] mechanic emerged from a simple observation: when couples take turns answering questions separately, they're more honest. When they come back together to compare answers, they're more curious.

## The Flow

The ritual moves through distinct phases:

1. **Names to Meet** — Enter both partner names, establishing the shared space
2. **Split Intro** — One partner starts while the other steps away
3. **Warm-Up Questions** — Individual reflection on appreciation and observations
4. **Handoff** — Physical passing of the phone creates a ritual moment
5. **Values Mirror** — Compare and reflect on what you both said
6. **The Gap** — Identify where you want to grow together
7. **Weekly Experiment** — Commit to one concrete action

## Why Phone Passing Works

There's something powerful about the physical handoff. It creates a boundary between "my turn" and "your turn" that wouldn't exist in a shared screen. The person waiting has to actually wait—no peeking, no influencing.

This is inspired by the "talking stick" concept from indigenous cultures, updated for the device we all carry anyway. The asymmetry is the point—it's what makes honest reflection possible.

## What I Learned

Building this crystallized a few [[tools for thinking:tools-for-thinking]] principles:

**State preservation matters.** The app maintains state throughout the entire ritual journey. If you close it mid-way, your progress should survive. Relationships are fragile enough without technology adding friction.

**Transitions are content.** The handoff screens aren't just navigation—they're part of the experience. "Hand the phone to [Partner Name]" is a prompt, not just a message. This is [[ritual design:ritual-design]] at the micro level.

**Warmth over polish.** The Post-it note aesthetic isn't accidental. This isn't a productivity tool; it's a relationship tool. It should feel approachable, even playful.

## Connections to Other Tools

The [[Seven Year Navigator:seven-year-career-navigator]] tackles a similar challenge: helping people see patterns in their lives that are too close to notice. Death to Divorce does this for relationships; the career tool does it for professional identity.

The [[Archetype Tool:archetypal-reflection-tool]] shares the "reveal, don't prescribe" philosophy. Neither tool tells you what to do—they show you what's already there.

## Try It

The tool is designed for couples who want to strengthen their connection without the overhead of formal therapy. Fifteen minutes, once a week, one phone between you.

The real question it asks: What would change if you treated your relationship like something that needs regular maintenance, not just crisis intervention?
