What does a year of AI collaboration look like when you quantify it?

I exported my Claude conversation history and ran it through analysis. The numbers surprised me.

## The Raw Numbers

- **888 conversations** (filtered to non-empty)
- **8,782 messages sent**
- **658,889 words written** to Claude
- **Longest conversation:** "Analyzing Life Phases and Personal Growth Frameworks" (188 messages)

That's roughly the length of *War and Peace*—written in fragments across a year.

## Conversation Patterns

Most of my conversations are short: 70% are under 10 messages. But the long ones are *long*. The top 30 conversations by word count account for a disproportionate amount of thinking.

| Conversation | Words | Messages |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| Claiming Integration Intelligence | 22,571 | 28 |
| Analyzing Life Phases | 11,047 | 188 |
| Relationship-Focused AI | 10,969 | 151 |
| Social Technical Systems | 9,438 | 3 |
| China-Russia-USA Triangle | 8,539 | 6 |

Notice the variation: "Social Technical Systems" is 9,438 words in just 3 messages. That's long-form thinking—pasting in documents, working through complex ideas. "Analyzing Life Phases" is 11,047 words across 188 messages—iterative exploration over time.

## Weekly Usage

My usage spiked after Claude 3.6 (October 2024). Before that release: steady but moderate. After: significant increase in both conversations and word count.

This isn't just "new feature excitement." The model improvements changed *how* I use Claude—more ambitious projects, longer contexts, deeper collaboration.

## Learning vs Doing

I categorized conversations by intent:
- **Learning mode** (research, understanding): 14.2%
- **Doing mode** (building, writing): 10.8%
- **Mixed mode**: 31.9%
- **Unclear**: 43.1%

The "unclear" bucket is interesting—these are conversations that don't fit clean categories. Often the most valuable ones.

**Learning:Doing ratio = 1.31:1**

I'm balanced, slightly tilted toward research. This matches my self-perception: I spend more time understanding problems than solving them.

## Recurring Topics (Knowledge Gaps?)

The analysis tracked which words appear in multiple conversation titles:

| Topic | Conversations |
|-------|--------------|
| analysis | 41 |
| project | 34 |
| research | 32 |
| strategy | 32 |
| design | 30 |
| voice | 28 |
| framework | 19 |

These might indicate knowledge gaps—areas I keep returning to because I haven't fully internalized them. Or they might be core interests that warrant deep engagement. Probably both.

## What I Upload

- **txt files:** 49.2% of uploads
- **text/plain:** 8.5%
- **text/html:** 8.4%
- **text/javascript:** 6.7%

I'm primarily working with text. Not surprising for a thinking tool, but it confirms I'm using Claude as a *writing partner* more than a code assistant.

## The Activity Heatmap

Peak usage: Tuesday-Thursday afternoons. Weekend usage exists but is lighter. This maps to my work schedule but also suggests I'm using Claude for *professional* thinking more than *personal* exploration.

The [[Thinking Territories Map:thinking-territories]] includes personal conversations, but the bulk of engagement is work-adjacent.

## What This Reveals

**I think in bursts.** Long conversations with breaks, not steady daily engagement.

**I revisit ideas.** The recurring topics suggest I'm circling themes rather than completing them. This is either deep engagement or procrastination. Possibly both.

**I've found my tool.** 658,889 words is commitment. Whatever Claude is for me—thinking partner, writing collaborator, research assistant—it's become integral.

## The Notebook

The full analysis is available as a [[Quarto notebook:notebook-link]]. Python code, matplotlib visualizations, all the data.

If you want to run this on your own Claude history:
1. Request a data export from Claude
2. The conversations come as JSON
3. Parse and analyze

## Connections

This data feeds the [[Thinking Territories Map:thinking-territories]] and informs the [[Visual Territories:visual-territories]] concept maps. Numbers become geography.
