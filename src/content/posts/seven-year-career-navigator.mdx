Every seven years, you become a different professional. Not metaphorically—research suggests our careers move through distinct phases that fundamentally reshape how we work, what we value, and what we need.

The [[Seven Year Navigator:7year-app]] is a career assessment tool that helps you understand which phase you're in and what comes next. It's a [[metacognitive tool:metacognitive-tools]]—designed to surface what you already sense but haven't named.

## The Research Foundation

This tool is built on Peter Weddle's work on career cycles. The core insight: careers aren't linear progressions up a ladder. They're cyclical journeys through three repeating phases.

### Year 1-2: The Learning Phase

You're absorbing. New role, new context, new relationships. The priority is competence—proving you belong here. Energy goes toward understanding the system you've entered.

**Whisper signals:** Feeling like an impostor is normal here. Feeling like an expert is a warning sign.

### Year 3-5: The Mastery Phase

You're contributing at peak capacity. The role fits. You know the game and you're playing it well. This is where promotions happen, where impact compounds.

**Whisper signals:** Boredom creeping in. Starting to notice what's broken in the system.

### Year 6-7: The Transition Phase

Something shifts. The role that once fit now feels constraining. You're either growing beyond it or growing resentful of it. This is where career changes germinate.

**Whisper signals:** Daydreaming about alternatives. Feeling "stuck" even while successful.

## The Whisper Detector

The most interesting feature is what I call the "Whisper Detector"—early warning signals that you're approaching a transition before you consciously recognize it.

These whispers are easy to dismiss:
- Sunday night dread that's new
- Volunteering for projects outside your role
- Mentoring others more than doing your own work
- Reading job descriptions "just to see"

The tool helps surface these signals before they become screams. This is [[contemplative pause:contemplative-pause]] applied to career reflection—slowing down enough to notice what you've been rushing past.

## What I Learned Building This

**Assessment design is hard.** The questions need to be specific enough to be useful but general enough to apply across industries. I went through many iterations before finding questions that resonated.

**Phases aren't prescriptive.** Some people thrive staying in Year 3-5 energy for a decade. The tool shouldn't create anxiety about "being in the wrong phase"—it should create awareness. This is the [[tools for thinking:tools-for-thinking]] principle: reveal, don't advise.

**Visualization matters.** Seeing your career as a cycle rather than a ladder changes how you interpret your current feelings. Restlessness at year 6 isn't failure; it's signal.

## The Dashboard

Beyond the initial assessment, the tool provides:
- **Key Metrics** — Where you are in the current cycle
- **Phase Overview** — What's typical for your phase
- **Next Actions** — Concrete steps for your situation
- **Stories** — Examples of others who navigated similar transitions
- **Journal** — Space for ongoing reflection

## Connections to Other Tools

The [[Death to Divorce:death-to-divorce]] tool does for relationships what this does for careers: creates a [[ritual design:ritual-design]] for noticing patterns over time. Both tools trust that awareness precedes change.

The [[Archetype Tool:archetypal-reflection-tool]] takes a more immediate approach—one session rather than ongoing tracking—but shares the same philosophy: you have the answers; you just need a lens to see them.

## Try It

If you've been in your current role for a while and something feels off—but you can't name what—this might help. Sometimes the most useful thing is simply knowing that what you're feeling has a pattern, and the pattern has a name.
