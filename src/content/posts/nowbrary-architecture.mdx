[[Your nowbrary:nowbrary-living-constellation]] isn't a filing system. It's a way of noticing how different books work in your thinking.

The three categories - Foundation Stones, Current Catalysts, and Horizon Markers - aren't rigid walls. They're windows into different modes of engagement with ideas.

## Foundation Stones

These are books you repeatedly return to for wisdom. They function as:

- References you quote naturally in conversations
- Texts that reveal new insights upon each rereading
- Works that have shaped your fundamental ways of thinking

Foundation stones don't just sit on your shelf. You return to them across years, finding different meanings each time. They're not about remembering what they said - they're about discovering what they're saying now, in this moment, to this version of you.

## Current Catalysts

These actively challenge your perspectives right now. You'll know them because:

- They're the ones creating those moments where you have to put the book down and stare into space
- You find yourself processing their ideas while doing other things
- They're shifting how you see patterns in your daily life

Current catalysts demand engagement. They might be new books or old ones you're reading differently. What matters is that they're catalyzing change in your thinking right now.

## Horizon Markers

These expand possibilities by revealing forgotten paths or new connections. They:

- Show you possible futures or alternative presents
- Make you productively uncomfortable
- Expand what you think is possible

Horizon markers aren't necessarily about the future. They might be historical works showing forgotten alternatives, or philosophical texts revealing new connections. They push your boundaries without demanding immediate integration.

## The Dynamic System

Here's what makes this architecture work: these categories interact.

Foundation stones give you stable ground for exploring new territory. Current catalysts might become foundation stones once their insights have integrated into your thinking. Horizon markers might become current catalysts when you're ready to engage with them deeply.

The suggested size of around 42 books maintains meaningful dialogue without creating noise. You're not cataloging - you're curating a living system.

## Books Migrate Seasonally

What serves as a foundation stone in winter might rest in summer. A horizon marker from last year might be this year's current catalyst. This isn't failure - it's how intellectual growth works.

Pay attention to when books want to leave your nowbrary. They're not gone forever. They're just resting until the next season when their insights become relevant again.

## Practical Guidance

Rather than rigid cataloging:
- Identify books you genuinely return to (foundation stones)
- Recognize what's currently demanding engagement (current catalysts)
- Notice patterns in what calls to you (horizon markers)
- Allow books to leave when their relevance passes

The framework reveals not just what you read, but how you think. That's more valuable than any organizational system.
