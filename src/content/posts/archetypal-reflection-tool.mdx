Most decision tools try to tell you what to do. This one does something different—it shows you *how you're already thinking*, and what that reveals about you.

The [[Archetype Tool:archetype-app]] is a [[metacognitive tool:metacognitive-tools]] that guides you through three rounds of archetypal lenses, then synthesizes what your choices reveal about your cognitive patterns.

## The Philosophy

This is explicitly not a decision-making app. It embodies the core [[tools for thinking:tools-for-thinking]] principle:

- **Non-prescriptive:** We reveal, we don't advise
- **Contextual:** Every response references your actual words
- **Progressive:** Each round builds on the last
- **Metacognitive:** The goal is self-awareness, not solutions
- **Contemplative:** The synthesis is an artifact to sit with

## The Three Logics

Behind the archetypes are three fundamental ways of knowing:

### Pattern Recognition (Magic)
Sees connections, resonances, analogies. Trusts intuition and emergence. Asks: "What pattern is trying to emerge?"

Archetypes: **The Explorer**, **The Weaver**

### Relational Negotiation (Religion)
Weighs values, honors competing claims. Seeks alignment and meaning. Asks: "What's the right thing here?"

Archetypes: **The Sage**, **The Mediator**

### Systematic Testing (Science)
Breaks down, tests, builds incrementally. Trusts observation and iteration. Asks: "What can I test right now?"

Archetypes: **The Builder**, **The Analyst**

## The Experience

You begin by describing your situation—open-ended, no judgment. Then you move through three rounds:

1. **Round 1:** Choose your initial lens, respond to its provocation
2. **Round 2:** Based on your response, new lenses unlock. Choose again.
3. **Round 3:** Your final lens completes the journey

After three rounds, the tool reveals your path: "You moved from Mediator to Weaver to Builder." This isn't random—it's the cognitive strategy you naturally employed when given freedom to choose.

## The Synthesis

The tarot-card-style synthesis at the end isn't a report—it's an artifact. It includes:

- **The Shift:** How your thinking evolved across rounds
- **The Pattern:** What your lens choices reveal
- **The Revelation:** The insight that emerged
- **A Wisdom Quote:** Something to sit with

The card is exportable. Some people save them, refer back to them. The goal is contemplation, not action items.

## The Contemplative Pause

Before the synthesis appears, there's a [[contemplative pause:contemplative-pause]]—a 3-second moment of nothing. This is designed friction. You need time to shift from "answering mode" to "receiving mode."

This is borrowed from [[ritual design:ritual-design]]: transitions matter. The pause isn't loading time; it's integration time.

## What I Learned

**Archetypes work better than personality types.** Saying "you're an Explorer" in this moment is different from saying "you're an INTJ forever." Archetypes are lenses you choose, not boxes you're placed in.

**Three rounds is the right number.** Fewer feels rushed. More feels exhausting. Three creates a narrative arc: beginning, middle, end.

**The provocation is everything.** Each archetype asks a specific question. "What becomes visible when you follow curiosity instead of certainty?" (Explorer) creates a different response than "What small thing could you test right now?" (Builder). The questions do the work.

**Timing matters.** The contemplative pauses aren't filler—they're part of the experience. Rushing to insight defeats the purpose.

## Connections to Other Tools

The [[Seven Year Navigator:seven-year-career-navigator]] applies similar principles to career reflection. Both tools trust that you already know something important—you just need the right frame to see it.

The [[Death to Divorce:death-to-divorce]] couples ritual uses a different mechanism—[[phone passing:phone-passing]] and partner comparison—but shares the "reveal, don't prescribe" philosophy. In all three tools, the insight comes from you, not from the algorithm.

## Try It

Bring something you're actually working through. The tool works best when you're genuinely uncertain, not when you're testing it with hypotheticals.

The question it ultimately asks: How do you think when no one's telling you how to think?
