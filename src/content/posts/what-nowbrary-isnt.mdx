[[Your nowbrary:nowbrary-living-constellation]] should feel alive, a bit unstable, maybe even slightly uncomfortable. If it's too polished, you're probably curating for the wrong audience.

## Five Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Curating for Appearance

Your nowbrary isn't a best-of collection meant to showcase refined taste. Some of your favorite books might not belong there right now - they're not currently in conversation with your thinking.

Include only books actively engaging with your current intellectual life. Trust that what's genuinely alive in your mind will be more interesting than what looks impressive on a shelf.

### 2. Aspirational Reading

Distinguish between what you're reading now versus what you intend to read. A nowbrary reflects present intellectual activity, not future intentions.

That stack of important books you've been meaning to read? That's a different list. Your nowbrary is about what's alive in your mind right now, not what you hope will be.

### 3. Forced Diversity

If your collection naturally concentrates on particular subjects or periods, that's fine. Such patterns authentically represent your current intellectual season.

You don't need to artificially balance across genres or time periods beyond the basic temporal span guideline. Let your genuine interests show. The patterns in what calls to you are data, not failures of curation.

### 4. Retaining Inactive Titles

Books previously important to your thinking may lose relevance. Permit them to rest without permanent removal - they might resurface later when their insights become relevant again.

The books that leave your nowbrary aren't being rejected. They're just not part of the current conversation. They might return next season, or next year, when you're ready for what they have to say.

### 5. Rigid Categorization

Treat organizational systems as flexible thinking tools rather than immutable labels. A book might be a foundation stone for you and a horizon marker for someone else.

The categories aren't about the books themselves - they're about your relationship with them right now. That relationship changes, and the categories should change with it.

## The Discomfort Test

If your nowbrary feels too settled, too perfect, too much like a museum exhibit, something's wrong. A living nowbrary has:

- Books in conversation with each other (and sometimes arguing)
- Unexpected juxtapositions that spark new connections
- A few uncomfortable presences that challenge your thinking
- Natural gaps where something's missing but you don't know what yet

That slight instability is a feature, not a bug.

## A Living Thing

Your nowbrary should breathe. It should change with the seasons of your thinking. It should surprise you sometimes - "Why is that book still here?" or "When did I start reaching for this one so often?"

Those surprises are signal. They show you patterns in your thinking you didn't notice consciously.

Let it breathe. Let it change. Let it be a little messy.
